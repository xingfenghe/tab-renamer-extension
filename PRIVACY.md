# Privacy Policy for Tab Renamer Extension

**Effective Date**: December 2024  
**Last Updated**: December 2024

## Overview
Tab Renamer is a Chrome extension that allows users to assign custom names to browser tabs for better organization. This privacy policy explains what data we collect (spoiler: none) and how your information is handled.

## Data Collection
**Tab Renamer does NOT collect any user data.**

### What We DON'T Collect
- ❌ **Browsing History**: We don't track what websites you visit
- ❌ **Personal Information**: No names, emails, addresses, or personal identifiers
- ❌ **Usage Analytics**: No tracking of how you use the extension
- ❌ **Search Queries**: We don't see what you search for
- ❌ **Login Information**: No passwords or authentication data
- ❌ **Device Information**: No hardware or system information
- ❌ **Location Data**: No geographical or location tracking

### What We Store Locally
The extension stores only the custom names you assign to tabs:
- **URL-to-name mappings**: e.g., `{"github.com/project": "My Work Project"}`
- **Storage location**: Your local browser only (Chrome's local storage API)
- **Data access**: Only you can access this data on your device

## How We Use Information
Since we don't collect any personal data, there's no information to use, share, or process.

### Local Storage Only
- All custom tab names are stored locally in your browser
- Data never leaves your device
- No external servers or databases involved
- No network requests or data transmission

## Third-Party Services
**We don't use any third-party services.**
- No analytics providers (Google Analytics, etc.)
- No advertising networks
- No external APIs or services
- No data sharing with third parties

## Children's Privacy
Tab Renamer is safe for users of all ages as we don't collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Data Security
While we don't collect data, the custom names you create are:
- **Stored locally**: Only on your device using Chrome's secure storage API
- **Protected by Chrome**: Chrome's built-in security protects your local data
- **User controlled**: You can clear all data by removing custom names or uninstalling

## User Rights and Control
You have complete control over your data:
- **View data**: See all your custom names in the extension popup
- **Delete data**: Remove custom names individually via the "Restore" button
- **Clear all data**: Uninstall the extension to remove all stored names
- **Data portability**: Currently stored locally; export features may be added in future versions

## Changes to This Policy
If we ever change our privacy practices (which is unlikely since we don't collect data), we will:
- Update this privacy policy
- Notify users through the Chrome Web Store update mechanism
- Provide clear information about any changes
